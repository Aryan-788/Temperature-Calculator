# Temperature-Calculator
This is a Python program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program has a simple command-line interface that prompts users to input a temperature value and the corresponding temperature scale. The program then converts the temperature to the other two scales and displays the results.
